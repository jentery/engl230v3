The point of this course is for you to gain media literacy skills pertinent to the practices of storytelling. You will have the opportunity to integrate audio, images, quotations, and even video into your writing about short fiction, comics, animations, dramatic podcasts, and video games.

You need to purchase only one book for this course: Alison Bechdel's [*Fun Home*](https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/book/9780618871711?course_id=122032). It's at the UVic Bookstore. Everything else is available online or in Brightspace. 

We're asking you to complete only **four assignments** this term, each 25% of your final mark. You can **revise one** of your first three assignments to improve your grade, and you'll submit all work via Brightspace. This means there are no research papers, presentations, or discussion forums in this course. There are no exams, either.
