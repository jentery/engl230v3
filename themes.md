Today's discussion is about some themes related to media that we will consider and revisit throughout the term. My thought is you probably know all this stuff already; you just may not approach it academically or in academic terms. For this reason, I'm asking you to provide us with the "primary sources" that will demonstrate these themes by way of example. In future meetings, most of your primary sources will be assigned (like *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT* next week). If we don't finish this discussion today, then we'll wrap up on Tuesday. 

## Seven Themes for Media 

Let's begin with the observation that media are fundamental to how people relate. This means media are not only the material substrate of art, storytelling, and communication. They are culture, too. 

How, for instance, might you describe the culture of particular media platforms today? What are some examples? 

EXAMPLES: 

Now let's consider seven themes for media. They are rather abstract (and thus limited in application), so we'll cook up examples from our everyday lives to demonstrate them. These themes are also meant to emphasize how media tend to serve conflicting or contradictory purposes. (Academics love contradiction. It's the bread and butter of humanities research.)

**Media turn this into that**. We use them to "capture" otherwise ephemeral activities for later reference. This also means that media are used for extraction (see histories of cultural preservation and settler colonialism), evidence (consider the use of images and video in courts), and activism (consider the use of phones to document instances of police brutality). 

Think of one activity and its corresponding medium. I'll give you an example: photography and image, where the image turns what we see through a camera into a file or photograph ("this" into "that").

EXAMPLES: 

**Media are magic and mirrors.** Most of us probably don't know how media turn this into that. The technical particulars are complex, and we rarely perceive them in action. Media are like magic this way, and they can thus be used for transformative or creative purposes. They are also used to document or record events (see above): to produce a "trace" or reference for what "really" or "actually" happened. They therefore also reflect or mirror reality. 

Think of a film or tv show that uses impressive worldbuilding and special effects (the "wow" or "whiz bang" of media) to portray historical events or periods. What seems like magic? What seems real? What's interesting about the co-existence of the two on the same screen or in the same world?

EXAMPLES: 

**We place our trust in media, and they make us vulnerable.** Media connect us while simultaneously alienating us. We may use them as means to an end, like messengers we trust to deliver a message we assume was received ("did you get my text?" "am I screaming into the abyss?"). Yet we never completely control media, including where they go and how they're interpreted. We also rely on them to remember things we might otherwise forget (or want to forget). This makes us vulnerable in many ways.

Think of an example of something you delegate to media (audio, image, or text) so that you don't have to remember it yourself. What's the perk? What's the risk? 

EXAMPLES: 

Also think of an example from popular culture where a file originally meant for private or internal communication was leaked or made public. Who was made vulnerable, by whom, and to what short- or long-term effects? 

EXAMPLES: 

**Media are made to store, share, and manipulate content, and they rot, malfunction, or obsolesce.** Media afford us with a sense of agency. Again, we use them for not only recording but also art and storytelling. They amplify our sense of agency as we produce content with them. But they are not outside of physics or history. They are subject to the weather; they rot and degrade. They also glitch or fail, and they rely on technologies that are made to obsolesce and be routinely patched or updated along the way. (I'm a Mac user. I know this all too well.) Media are thus agents of a sort, too. Where there's user agency, there's also resistance in the materials. 

Think of a moment when you lost a lot of work to a glitch, crash, update, or the like. How did you respond? What could you recover? 

EXAMPLES: 

**Media are standards for experimentation.** Media are in the standardization business. Think of all the formats (MP3, MOV, JPG, GIF, HTML) that are containers for media and publication. We need these standards to communicate across networks and to make and preserve a lot of content. We also learn the habits or conventions associated with them: standardized menus, keyboards, layouts, interfaces, and even languages. Ironically enough, there's a lot of repetition, automation, and normalization involved in even the most experimental media practices. 

Think of the software or app you know best. What habits have you formed to use it efficiently or effectively? Which file formats are involved? What sort of experimental or creative stuff can you do with it? 

EXAMPLES: 

**Immediacy relies on abundant remediation.** Old and new media collocate and even coalesce in today's spaces of media production. The QWERTY typewriter becomes a popular keyboard, or skeuomorphs like trash cans and analog dials appear as icons on your computer screen. So much history! New tech draws upon what's familiar to then reinvent it. Curiously enough, as the speed and capacities of machines increase, our experiences feel more and more immediate (with greater access to more and more content), yet those same experiences also involve more and more media. Content and interfaces are thus frequently designed to grab our attention and keep it, usually by focusing on some media while letting others recede from view. 

Think about an app, site, or game you consider to be immersive. To what does it draw your attention? What does it want you to ignore? Or, when does it feel immediate? And when does it feel mediated? 

EXAMPLES: 

**Media are mechanics and messages: mechanisms for play and story.** Today, media frequently encourage interaction, where they turn input into output for the sake of engagement. Play is everywhere, from pressing play to playing games. Stories (what's told) and narrative (how it's told) are entwined with these types of play. People may move through games and other fictions like environments, if you will, clicking and pressing buttons as they go. People also tell their own stories about their play experiences, extending or altering what's canon. They make their own fun.

Think of a game or interactive work that's known primarily for the stories people tell about playing it. Why do you think it is so effective this way? What is its narrative or social appeal?
