# Prompt for Revisions

Please note that a response to this prompt is *optional*. If you respond, your mark can only improve. 

Select *one* of your responses to a prompt this term: your response to Prompt 1, 2, *or* 3. Review the feedback and revise accordingly. As you revise, please: 

* Use track changes if you are revising a Word document or the like. This way, we can easily identify the changes you made. 
* If you are editing audio, video, or images, then don't worry about tracking those revisions. You can speak to your changes in a written description if you'd like. 
* Feel free to increase the original word count (where applicable) by 150 words. 

## Assessment 

Your mark for Prompt 1, 2, or 3 can only improve. We will assess the revised response using the original assessment criteria. You might revisit the original prompt, especially its assessment criteria. 

## What to Submit 

Submit a revised version of what you initially submitted in response to Prompt 1, 2, or 3, using track changes for Word docs or the like, with up to 150 more words (if you'd like and where applicable). As with the assessment criteria, you might revisit the original prompt, especially the "What to Submit" section, to ensure you submit all the components outlined in the assignment.
