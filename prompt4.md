# Prompt 4 

During Weeks 9, 11, and 12, we discussed how action is a medium and also what it means for stories to have interfaces. How do stories turn input into output? What role does feedback play in narrative? How are mechanics expressive? 

This prompt asks you to share your knowledge of action and interfaces by demaking a game, playtesting it, or expanding its lore. 

## Aim

Your response to this prompt should demonstrate how games compel their audiences to act, if only by pressing a button or selecting an option in a menu. We've talked a lot about choice and satisfaction in this context. *Choice*: What actions or “verbs" do games afford players? Does less choice result in boredom? Do too many choices result in confusion? Where do we find variety in a given game, and where do we find repetition? *Satisfaction*: To what degree are desirable outcomes attainable? How uncertain are the outcomes, and how predictable are they? Across story and mechanics, what's the right sort of difficulty for you as a player? 

## Format 

You've three options for this prompt. Please pick one. 

1. *Demake*. This option asks you to turn *Celeste* into a text game. Imagine you've a friend who is interested in *Celeste*'s story but will not play platformers. You decide to give them a gift: you use [Twine](https://twinery.org/) to demake a chapter or two of *Celeste* into a series of linked passages with choices and multiple paths through the narrative. One of your friend's favourite games is [*With Those We Love Alive*](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive), so maybe you use its style and format for inspiration. Either way, your hope is to pique your friend's interest in *Celeste* by rendering its story more accessible, if not more satisfying, to them. You use the [Twine app](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/releases) to make your game or build in it in [your browser](https://twinery.org/2/#/). Once you finish demaking a chapter or two of *Celeste*, you give the text game to your friend along with a letter that's about 300 words long. Your letter tells them: 1) which part of *Celeste* you demade into text, 2) why you selected that part of *Celeste* to demake, 3) how your text game uses action or an interface to communicate part of *Celeste*'s story, and 4) what about the text game you hope is accessible and satisfying for your friend. Your friend (perhaps an actual friend!?!) is your intended audience, so your writing is informal and follows the conventions of a friendly letter. You integrate games terminology into your letter in such a way that your friend, who doesn't play platformers, understands it. 
2. *Playtesting*. This option asks you to provide the makers of *With Those We Love Alive* or *Celeste* with feedback on choice and satisfaction in their game. Pick one of these games and then imagine it hasn't been published yet. The team behind the game employs you to share your experiences playing the game, with attention not to bugs or quality assessment *per se* but rather to your overall satisfaction with the choices the game affords and how it affords them. They also ask you to select a 5- to 15-minute slice of the game for the sake of focused and deliberate play. Use either 4-5 minutes of video or about 750 words to give them your feedback. Maybe you underscore how the game tracks your decisions and nudges you to follow certain story beats. Perhaps you attend to what the game renders attainable or unattainable. Or you could highlight when the game's mechanics are expressive or rewarding. Whatever the path, they're eager to hear more about how their game articulates action and mechanics with story and experience. Which choices in the game struck you as especially important, and how satisfying were the actions you could perform? The game's team is your intended audience, and they're hoping for descriptive feedback (not suggestions for improvement). You can assume they're familiar with games terminology and, of course, the intricacies of their own game.  
3. *Fanlore*. This option asks you to interact with *With Those We Love Alive* or *Celeste* by expanding the lore for one of its characters. You've studied both games in this course, and we've discussed how each has important characters or NPCs that shape the story. Yet the backstories of these characters may be opaque to us. Now's your time to change that. Use whatever format you prefer to give fans of *Celeste* or *With Those We Love Alive* more insight into the backstory of one NPC. Perhaps you communicate that insight through a journal entry, a text exchange, a phone conversation, a photograph, social media, or . . . (See what the *Celeste* team did with [Theo's Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/theounderstars/?hl=en), for example.) Whatever your approach, my advice is to keep it simple and avoid scope creep (i.e., doing too much with what little time and resources you've left in the term). Please use about 300 words to briefly describe your fanlore (i.e., your backstory for a particular NPC). Your written description should tell fans of the game: 1) which NPC you selected, 2) why you selected that NPC, 3) how your backstory for that NPC enriches the experience of the game, and 4) what about your fanlore you hope is satisfying for fans. The game's fans are your intended audience, so your writing can be informal. You can also assume they're familiar with games terminology and, of course, the intricacies of their own game.  

## Audiences 

A friend (imaginary or real) is your audience for Option 1, "Demake." The game's team is your audience for Option 2, "Playtesting." And fans of the game are your audience for Option 3, "Fanlore."

## Twine

If you're new to Twine (for Option 1 or even Option 3), then I recommend consulting Julie Funk's tutorial, which I circulated in both Brightspace and the class notes. 

Upload your game's HTML file to Brightspace to submit it. 

## Assessment 

I will assess your response to Prompt 4 based on the following criteria: 

* *Engagement with the prompt and class material* (25%): how well and to what degree your response follows the prompts and engages class material, including games terminology and our discussions about action as a medium 
* *Selection of material from the primary source* (25%): how effectively your response chooses material from *Celeste* or *With Those We Love Alive* for the sake of engagement 
* *Quality of the response* (25%): how effectively your response demonstrates the ways games compel their audiences to act or engage them (e.g., through a demake, playtesting, or fanlore)
* *Awareness of audience* (25%): how effectively your response addresses its intended audience and demonstrates of an awareness of them 

You will receive one mark for each of these four criteria, which will be tallied (.25 x 4) to result in your grade for Prompt 4. I will use [UVic's grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) for assessment, according to this rubric: "exceeds and raises expectations" (A+), "exceeds expectations" (A, A-), "exceeds some expectations" (B+), "meets expectations" (B, B-), "meets some expectations" (C+, C), "meets few expectations" (D), and "no submission." 

Since this is your final assignment, you will not have an opportunity to revise it. Thanks for understanding. 

## What to Submit 

Your response to Prompt 4 should be a Twine game accompanied by a 300-word letter (Option 1), 4-5 minutes of video or about 750 words (Option 2), or fanlore (any format) accompanied by a 300-word description (Option 3). 

You should submit it via Brightspace. Look for the "Prompt 4" assignment. Feel free to submit more than one file. If I cannot access the file or its format, then I'll let you know. 

Please include references somewhere in your submission (in the comments or at the end of a Word document, for instance). Here are citations for the two works at hand:

* Extremely OK Games. *Celeste*. 2018. 
* Porpentine Charity Heartscape and Brenda Neotenomie. *With Those We Love Alive*. 2014. 

Email me if you've any questions about making, formatting, or uploading any of these files. I don't want you to spend much time on the technical particulars, especially if you're just wondering what I can access or download.  

## When to Submit It 

Please submit your response to Prompt 4 via Brightspace by Tuesday, December 13th at 1:30pm. If you would like a 48-hour extension (no questions asked), then please request it by email. I cannot extend the due date beyond Thursday, December 15th at 1:30pm. Thanks for understanding.
