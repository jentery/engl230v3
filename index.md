# tl;dr Version of this Syllabus

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward you through this course?

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this syllabus](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch. 

# Course Description 

How do we not only *read* stories but also *see*, *hear*, *watch*, and *play* them? This course introduces you to the intersections of media and literature and, more specifically, how text, audio, image, and interfaces are designed for contemporary fiction. We'll engage numerous formats, from short fiction and comics to animations, dramatic podcasts, and a variety of games. Along the way, you'll learn how to write about media and fiction for the web and how to integrate a range of sensory modalities (audition, vision, and touch) into your critical work. Since this course is an introduction, I'll assume you’ve never taken a class in media studies.

Please note: "media" in the title implies "audio, images, text, and interfaces," not news or communication outlets ("the media"). Thanks! 

# Aims 

We designed this course for you to: 

* Develop a vocabulary to approach media in the context of fiction and storytelling.  
* Interpret what audio, images, text, and interfaces *do* in fiction. We'll practice various techniques for watching, reading, playing, and listening to the stories people make with media. 
* Communicate critically with audio, images, text, and interfaces. You'll have opportunities to practice composing across these media, with an informed audience in mind. 
* Use media as evidence in criticism. You will have the opportunity to integrate audio, images, quotations, and even video into your writing about fiction.

Each of these four outcomes should apply to work across disciplines and occupations, regardless of your major at UVic. They are useful whenever you're analyzing media or writing for the web.

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about audio, games, and experimental fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca). 

(More about Babak coming soon.)

# Assignments

We're back to campus during COVID-19. These are complex and overwhelming times, so we'll try to keep this course as simple and clear as possible. 

We're asking you to complete only **four assignments** this term, each 25% of your final mark. You'll have an opportunity to **revise one** of your first three assignments to improve your grade. (Your mark can only improve with revision.)

For each assignment, you will respond briefly to a prompt (available in Brightspace) through a combination of audio, images, video, and/or text. The prompt will ask you to examine assigned materials, with attention to detail, from a critical perspective. It will also nudge you to enact a media study of fiction: to demonstrate concepts and perform techniques discussed during class. 

Each response will be assessed based on a rubric provided in the prompt itself, and you will submit all four responses via Brightspace. (Please do not submit them via email or in print.)  

This means there are no research papers, presentations, or discussion forums in this course. There are no exams, either. 

As for scheduling, you will know 50% of your final mark by Tuesday, October 25th and 75% by Tuesday, November 15th. Optional revisions to one response will be due by Friday, December 2nd, and your final response to a prompt will be due by Tuesday, December 13th (during the exam period).

# Structure

We'll meet three days a week (TWF) from 1:30 to 2:20pm. A typical week will include a lecture, a large group discussion about a particular work, and a workshop on critical media literacy. We will use Word in Microsoft Offic 265 to provide you with detailed lecture notes alongside audio recordings (in Brightspace) of class meetings. These notes and recordings are to be used solely for the sake of the course (and making it more accessible) and should *not* be circulated outside of it. Feedback on this approach is welcome from you along the way. 

For details about what we will discuss and when, see the schedule below.

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *we'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut materials. We've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

We suggest dedicating to this course 3 to 5 hours of study each week, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (TWF). To frame expectations and decrease overwork, we assign to each week in the schedule a number of recommended hours. Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

In Brightspace, we will also message you once each week with an update on how the course is progressing and what you may wish to consider as we move forward (to plan for reading, assignments, due dates, and whatnot).

# Materials  

Here's a list of works ("assigned texts") we'll study this term. You need to purchase only the first one (Bechdel's [*Fun Home*](https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/book/9780618871711?course_id=122032), which is $25 new and $19 used). The rest are available either online (public) or in Brightspace (private to the class). If you'd like to purchase some of the games, then feel free, especially if you decide to write about them.  

* The graphic novel and memoir, [*Fun Home*](https://www.hmhco.com/shop/books/Fun-Home/9780547347004) (2006), by Alison Bechdel (*please purchase*)

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional. 

We'll also provide you with notes and audio that will document material from lectures and discussions. The notes will be circulated as a Word doc in Microsoft Office 365, and we will invite you to comment, converse, and ask questions in the margins. The audio will be available in Brightspace. Again, we ask that you do not circulate the recordings or notes beyond the course. Thanks a bunch. 

You do not need to purchase any software for this course; however, you'll need access to the internet and a computer. We will use Brightspace and Word for Office 365, both provided by UVic. If you've never used Microsoft Office 365 at UVic, then you may need to activate it first by visiting [onlineservices.uvic.ca](https://onlineservices.uvic.ca/).  

# Schedule

# Policies 

Here are the policies for this course. If anything is unclear, ignorant, or mistaken, then please let us know. We'll correct it. 

### Prerequisites 

There are no prerequisites for this 200-level English course. 
  
### Assessment and Feedback

Responses to two prompts are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these two assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

We will use UVic's [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to produce rubrics to assess your work. We will not post marks publicly or outside our offices, and we do not use plagiarism detection software.

All assignments should be submitted via Brightspace. We will also use Brightspace to provide written feedback on each of your responses, regardless of when you submit them. If you ever want additional feedback, then feel free to ask us. We can provide it in person or via email. 

Throughout the term, we'll request feedback (verbal and in writing) from you on how the course is going. We'll also ask you to complete Course Experience Surveys at the end of the term (during our last meeting).

### Late Submissions and Extensions

We have a "no questions asked" late policy for any assignments (excluding your response to Prompt 4, due in December) submitted within one week (five working days) of its due date. We simply ask that you complete an online form, which we'll circulate during class in September, to apply that policy. Your response to the online form will help us to track work that's arriving a few days late. It'll also save you an email. Of course, we recommend submitting everything on time, but we know that life happens, and for late work we will never expect any sort of documentation from you. 

We will deduct two points per working day for every assignment submitted more than one week (five working days) late. Please email me (Jentery) if you need more than a week's extension. Again, we will comment on all assigned work we receive from you during the term, regardless of when it's submitted.   

### Attendance, Participation, and Recordings

We will assume you are attending each one of meetings this term. If you are unable to attend a particular meeting, then please email one of us in advance. You do not need to provide us with documentation for an absence. There are no participation marks or the like in this course. 

With your permission, we may record audio of our sessions and circulate it via Brightspace. You will have the option to limit personal information shared in the recording. If you have other questions or concerns regarding class recording and privacy, then please contact [privacyinfo@uvic.ca](mailto:privacyinfo@uvic.ca).  

### Communications 

The best way to communicate with me (Jentery) is by email ([jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca)) or during office hours, which are Thursday, 12:30 - 2:30pm. I respond to email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 

### Learning Climate  

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. We are expected to adhere to [UVic's equity and human rights policies](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/) and the [Trifaculty Code of Professional Behaviour](https://www.uvic.ca/services/advising/assets/docs/tri-fac-student-code-of-conduct.pdf). You should alert us immediately if you have any questions about these policies and their application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity

### Accessibility

If you have a disability or health consideration that may require supports, please feel free to approach us and/or the [Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/services/cal/) as soon as possible. CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate supports. We will never ask you to disclose a diagnosis to us, and we know that access needs are social, cultural, and structural issues that aren't always addressed, or adequately addressed, by institutions such as the academy. 

Auto-generated transcription and captioning may be enabled in this course. Please be aware that automated transcription and captioning is at best 70-90% accurate and by nature will include errors. This depends on the subject matter, speaker, audio quality, and the like. Words prone to error include specialized terminology and proper names. We ask that you refer to the audio feed for clarification of any errors. If you find transcription or captioning that is offensive, please contact us. If you require captions as part of academic supports, please contact us and/or CAL.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 

We aim to create an inclusive learning environment that attends to difference and honours each of you, including your experiences as well as the intersections of race, gender, disability, sexuality, religion, power, and class. We want to be a resource for you, and we are also still learning. If something is said in class (by anyone, including us) that makes you feel uncomfortable, then don't hesitate to talk with us. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your university records, then let us know and we'll correct the documents provided to us. If your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside of class, then just keep us posted and we'll make adjustments. We also welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the course and/or its culture and materials, and we will make available mechanisms for anonymous feedback since you may prefer them. If you'd rather speak with someone outside the course, then Luke Carson (chair) and Erin Ellerbeck (undergraduate adviser) in English are excellent resources.

### Basic Needs 

We want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let us know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any supports to succeed. We'll do our best to help. If, for instance, you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as we do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) full of resources. They offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation and confidential assessment, counselling services (individual and small group), and referrals. Many of these programs are connected with Health Services, which you may contact by phone. 

The [Student Services website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/departments/student-services/index.php) lists several policies that you might want to know about and may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this course, but they're still important.
