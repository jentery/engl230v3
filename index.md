# Course Description 

How do we not only *read* stories but also *see*, *hear*, *watch*, and *play* them? This course introduces you to the intersections of media and literature and, more specifically, how text, audio, image, and interfaces are designed for contemporary fiction. We'll engage numerous formats, from short fiction and comics to animations, dramatic podcasts, and a variety of games. Along the way, you'll learn how to write about media and fiction for the web and how to integrate a range of sensory modalities (audition, vision, and touch) into your critical work. Since this course is an introduction, I'll assume you’ve never taken a class in media studies.

Please note: "media" in the title implies "audio, images, text, and interfaces," not news or communication outlets ("the media"). Thanks! 

# Aims 

We designed this course for you to: 

* Develop a vocabulary to approach media in the context of fiction and storytelling.  
* Interpret what audio, images, text, and interfaces *do* in fiction. We'll practice various techniques for watching, reading, playing, and listening to the stories people make with media. 
* Communicate critically with audio, images, text, and interfaces. You'll have opportunities to practice composing across these media, with an informed audience in mind. 
* Use media as evidence in criticism. You will integrate audio, images, and even video alongside quotations into your writing about fiction.

Each of these four outcomes should apply to work across disciplines and occupations, regardless of your major at UVic. They are useful whenever you're analyzing media or writing for the web.

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about audio, games, and experimental fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca).
