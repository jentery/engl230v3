# Course Description 

How do we not only *read* stories but also *see*, *hear*, *watch*, and *play* them? This course introduces you to the intersections of media and literature and, more specifically, how text, audio, image, and interfaces are designed for contemporary fiction. We'll engage numerous formats, from short fiction and comics to animations, dramatic podcasts, and a variety of games. Along the way, you'll learn how to write about media and fiction for the web and how to integrate a range of sensory modalities (audition, vision, and touch) into your critical work. Since this course is an introduction, I'll assume you’ve never taken a class in media studies.

Please note: "media" in the title implies "audio, images, text, and interfaces," not news or communication outlets ("the media"). Thanks! 

# Aims 

We designed this course for you to: 

* Develop a vocabulary to approach media in the context of fiction and storytelling.  
* Interpret what audio, images, text, and interfaces *do* in fiction. We'll practice various techniques for watching, reading, playing, and listening to the stories people make with media. 
* Communicate critically with audio, images, text, and interfaces. You'll have opportunities to practice composing across these media, with an informed audience in mind. 
* Use media as evidence in criticism. You will integrate audio, images, and even video alongside quotations into your writing about fiction.

Each of these four outcomes should apply to work across disciplines and occupations, regardless of your major at UVic. They are useful whenever you're analyzing media or writing for the web.

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about audio, games, and experimental fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca). 

# Assignments

We're back to campus during COVID-19. These are complex and overwhelming times, so we'll try to keep this course as simple and clear as possible. 

We're asking you to complete only **four assignments** this term, each 25% of your final mark. You'll have an opportunity to **revise one** of your first three assignments to improve your grade. (Your mark can only improve with revision.)

For each assignment, you will respond briefly to a prompt (available in Brightspace) through a combination of audio, images, video, and/or text. The prompt will ask you to examine assigned materials, with attention to detail, from a critical perspective. It will also nudge you to enact a media study of fiction: to demonstrate concepts and perform techniques discussed during class. 

Each response will be assessed based on a rubric provided in the prompt itself, and you will submit all four responses via Brightspace. (Please do not submit them via email or in print.)  

This all means there are no research papers, presentations, or discussion forums in this course. There are no exams, either. 

As for scheduling, you will know 50% of your final mark by Tuesday, October 25th and 75% by Tuesday, November 15th. Optional revisions to one response will be due by Friday, December 2nd, and your final response to a prompt will be due by Tuesday, December 13th (during the exam period).

# Structure

We'll meet three days a week (TWF) from 1:30 to 2:20pm. A typical week will include a lecture, a large group discussion about a particular work, and a workshop on critical media literacy. We will use Word in Microsoft Offic 265 to provide you with detailed lecture notes alongside audio recordings (in Brightspace) of class meetings. These notes and recordings are to be used solely for the sake of the course (and making it more accessible) and should *not* be circulated outside of it. Feedback on this approach is welcome from you along the way. 

For details about what we will discuss and when, see the schedule below.

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *we'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut materials. We've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

We suggest dedicating to this course 3 to 5 hours of study each week, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (TWF). To frame expectations and decrease overwork, we assign to each week in the schedule a number of recommended hours. Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

In Brightspace, we will also message you once each week with an update on how the course is progressing and what you may wish to consider as we move forward (to plan for reading, assignments, due dates, and whatnot).

# Materials  

Here's a list of works ("assigned texts") we'll study this term. You need to purchase only the first one (Bechdel's [*Fun Home*](https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/book/9780618871711?course_id=122032), which is $25 new and $19 used). The rest are available either online (public) or in Brightspace (private to the class). If you'd like to purchase some of the games, then feel free, especially if you decide to write about them.

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional. 

We'll also provide you with notes and audio that will document material from lectures and discussions. The notes will be circulated as a Word doc in Microsoft Office 365, and we will invite you to comment, converse, and ask questions in the margins. The audio will be available in Brightspace. Again, we ask that you do not circulate the recordings or notes beyond the course. Thanks a bunch. 

You do not need to purchase any software for this course; however, you'll need access to the internet and a computer. We will use Brightspace and Word for Office 365, both provided by UVic. If you've never used Microsoft Office 365 at UVic, then you may need to activate it first by visiting [onlineservices.uvic.ca](https://onlineservices.uvic.ca/).
